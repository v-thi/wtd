## Current Referral Perks

### Added Team Members

Perk added: 11 Aug 2020

For supercharged plans users, when a referred company subscribes to a supercharged plan, you will be able to add more team members to your project above the plan's limit. The number of extra allowed team members is decided by the plan the referred company subscribed to:

- **Startup**: 3 added team members.
- **Grow**: 5 added team members.

Terms and conditions:

- To redeem this perk, [contact us](/support-center/contact-us) with the name of the referred company and your referral code after the referred company has subscribed.
- The referred company must not be affiliated with the referring company.
- If the referred company unsubscribes during the first month of their subscription, DeveloperHub.io Ltd may remove the extra team members added due to the referral without notice.
- This perk can be redeemed multiple times for every referred company that subscribes to a supercharged plan.
- DeveloperHub.io Ltd may refuse to grant the perk in its own discretion.
