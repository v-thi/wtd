Custom login for readers on %product% is provided using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). By using JWT login:

- You control who has access to your docs without having to share a global password/link.
- You can [personalise](/support-center/personalised-docs) the docs to the logged in reader.
- You control when the access expires.

You can use JWT login with your [SSO provider](/support-center/custom-login#reader-authentication-through-ssocognitosalesforce) (cognito, Okta, Salesforce...) to allow or deny access for readers according to your own logic.

## How JWT Login works

When JWT login is enabled, the flow of login would be as such:

1. The reader would either land on the docs site unauthenticated and be redirected to the login URL, or they start from your own website to get to the login URL.
2. When they get to the login URL, your backend servers would sign a JWT token using an [API Key](/support-center/api-key) that has `access.write` permission, construct a URL containing the JWT token, and redirect the reader to it. The URL is the URL of your docs site.
3. When the reader tries to access the docs site unauthenticated with the JWT token in the URL, our backend servers will verify the token and create an access token with the expiry defined in the token. The reader can now access the docs site.
4. When the reader access token expires, they no longer can access the content, and would be redirected again to the login URL where this process repeats.


{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
We do provide the URL which the reader tried to access in a query param called `redirect`. Your servers may read this query param and use it as the redirect URL instead of the landing page of your docs.
{% /callout %}


## How to enable JWT Login

To setup JWT login on %product%, follow these steps:

1. From the sidebar, choose Project Settings {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group inv-icon" /%}.
2. Under General Settings, choose Make Private (or Manage Access).
3. Select JWT.
4. Provide a login URL, read more about [login URL](/support-center/password-protection#using-login-url) here.
5. Click Save.

## Signing JWT

To authorise and authenticate access to your docs site, you must sign a JWT token using an [API Key](/support-center/api-key) that has `access.write` permission. First, ensure that you have the API Key generated. The supported signing algorithms are HS256 and HS512.

There are numerous libraries for most programming languages for signing JWT, see [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) for details,

Example code to sign the JWT:


{% code %}
{% tab language="javascript" %}
const sign = require('jsonwebtoken').sign;
const apiKey = '689c3ce8e7c68b7c7f86acca6a028e6f8656eb792b19a334f8e3f2a56ca8f561';

function getSignedDeveloperHubUrl() {
  const docsUrl = 'https://docs.pied-piper.com'; // Your docs site URL. It may be a URL to a specific page or API Reference.
  const payload = {
    version: 1, // Controls the version of custom login. Do not remove.
    vars: { // Personalise documentation by injecting variables here if needed
      userId: 1234
    },
    error_redirect_url: 'https://pied-piper.com' // Optional: Redirects to this URL on error
  }; // Place here any variables you want to inject to personalise the docs.
  const expiresIn = 24 * 60 * 60; // Expiry, preferably 1 day, the shorter the more secure. Expiry must be defined.

  const token = sign(payload, apiKey, {expiresIn: expiresIn});

  return `${docsUrl}?jwt=${token}`;
}
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}


Once the URL is generated, you may redirect your reader to the generated URL to provide them access to the docs.


{% callout type="warning" title="Sign only in the backend" %}
To sign a JWT, you need an API Key with `access.write` permission. The API Key is a secret and it should never be shared online.
{% /callout %}


For easy access, you can also generate a JWT directly from the Manage Access window by clicking on "Generate JWT" and selecting the expiry value.

## Example Express App

An example express app which you may use:


{% code %}
{% tab language="javascript" %}
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const sign = require('jsonwebtoken').sign;
const port = 1234;

const apiKey = '689c3ce8e7c68b7c7f86acca6a028e6f8656eb792b19a334f8e3f2a56ca8f561';

function getSignedDeveloperHubUrl(url) {
  const docsUrl = url || 'https://docs.pied-piper.com';
  const payload = {
    version: 1,
    vars: {
      user: {
        id: 1234,
        name: "John"
      }
  	}
  };
  const expiresIn = 24 * 60 * 60;

  const token = sign(payload, apiKey, {expiresIn: expiresIn});

  return `${docsUrl}?jwt=${token}`;
}

app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
  res.redirect(getSignedDeveloperHubUrl(req.query.redirect));
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Reader login app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
});
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}


## Limiting Access to One Device

To limit a single JWT token to give access only on one device, a unique `jti` may be added in the payload. For example:


{% code %}
{% tab language="javascript" title="" highlightLines="4" %}
function getSignedDeveloperHubUrl(url) {
  const docsUrl = url || 'https://docs.pied-piper.com';
  const payload = {
    jti: require('uuid').v4(),
    version: 1,
    vars: {
      user: {
        id: 1234,
        name: "John"
      }
  	}
  };
  const expiresIn = 24 * 60 * 60;

  const token = sign(payload, apiKey, {expiresIn: expiresIn});

  return `${docsUrl}?jwt=${token}`;
}
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}


In this example, a UUID was used to provide uniqueness for the `jti` parameter, but any random sequence can be used.

If the same JWT was used to access a project again, the reader would be denied access and shown "Token has already been used" message.

## Handling JWT Login Error

You can provide an `error_redirect_url`  in the payload of your JWT. When an error occurs (because token expired or signature verification failed), the user will be redirected to that URL with a query param added `dh_jwt_error` containing the error message.

## Reader Authentication through SSO/Cognito/Salesforce

To provide reader authentication through SSO, cognito, salesforce or other identity providers, the steps are as follows:

1. Once the reader reaches the docs site unauthenticated, they will be taken to the login URL which you set up in %product%.
2. The login URL is a page that is hosted by you, which performs the authentication needed using SSO, cognito, salesforce, other identity providers, or your own login system. The user would log in as they normally would on your systems.
3. According to your own logic, if you wish to allow the user to have access to the docs, then you would [sign a JWT](/support-center/custom-login#signing-jwt) and forward the user back to the docs site with the token added to the URL.

In summary: %product% does not directly integrate with the identity providers for reader authentication. The integration is done through your backend systems which makes it highly customisable, and allows the personalisation of the docs for your users. If you already have a login system, then most of the work for reader authentication is done. All that is needed is a new API GET endpoint (login URL) which signs the JWT.
