Links can be added to your documentation index. Links can either be:

- External: Linking to an external URL. These links open in a new tab and would show with {% icon classes="fas fa-external-link-alt" /%} icon.
- Internal: Linking to another part of the documentation. Internal links must start with `/`. For example to link to this page, the correct URL would be `/support-center/external-links`. Internal links open in the same tab and would show with {% icon classes="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right" /%} icon.


{% callout type="warning" title="Basic links" %}
Note that internal links are not validated, and do not migrate automatically if the linked page URL changed
{% /callout %}
