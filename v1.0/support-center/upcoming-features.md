We always have something exciting to deliver for you.

Here are a list of features where we have invested heavily but have not completed yet because we need customer's input:

- GraphQL references.
- Conditional blocks.
- Reader SSO.

If you'd like to have any of these implemented, please [contact us](/support-center/contact-us).
