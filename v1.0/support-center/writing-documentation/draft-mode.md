Draft mode empowers your editors with enhanced capabilities, offering the flexibility to write without restrictions and the ability to publish content at the optimal moment. It is a staging environment for pages, enabling ongoing work and review until they are fully prepared for publication.

Writing documentation with a pen is a thing of the past. Our editors seek the ability to make adjustments seamlessly without fearing making errors.

### How is it different than changing the publish setting?

Unpublishing a page makes it unavailable to readers. However, you can keep a page published with its latest stable content while working on a draft. This way, you can update content without interrupting access to the current version.

## Page Life-Cycle

Each page could have three states:

- [Unpublished](/support-center/unlisting) {% icon classes="fas fa-circle red-text" /%} : The page has never been published or was unpublished.
- Listed, published.
- Listed, in draft mode {% icon classes="far fa-file-alt" /%}.

## Listed, published

Once you publish the unlisted draft page, it becomes listed. Listed means that it is visible to your readers. Also, the changes that were in draft mode have now been applied and published.

{% /image %}

The **Publish** {% icon classes="fas fa-forward" /%} button will indicate that the page is published.

## Listed, in draft mode

If you edit a listed and published page, it goes back into draft mode. That means your readers can still access the page and read the contents as they were listed, but your teammates can keep making edits only visible to them.

Publish when you are ready!

{% /image %}

Draft pages show a draft page icon in the index, and the control buttons allow you to publish.

## Draft Pages History

Every draft is saved in the page history and is indicated as a draft version. To discard all draft changes and to revert to the published version:

1. Click on {% icon classes="fas fa-history" /%} Show Published under the page title.
2. Make any edits.
3. Save the page again and publish it.
