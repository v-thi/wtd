%product% generates beautiful and powerful API References from your API specification files. See our [Swagger Petstore](https://swagger.developerhub.io/v1.0/swagger-petstore/ref) demo here.

See [Uploading References](/support-center/uploading-references) to learn how to add an API reference to your version.

## Deleting API References

To delete an API reference:

- Click on References {% icon classes="fas fa-vector-square inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
- Select the reference to delete.
- Click on the red bin {% icon classes="far fa-trash-alt red-bg-icon" /%} next to the reference title at the top.
- Confirm your deletion.


{% callout type="warning" title="Warning" %}
Once an API reference is deleted, it cannot be retrieved back.
{% /callout %}


## Ordering API References

To change an API reference order in the picker:

- Click on References {% icon classes="fas fa-vector-square inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
- Drag the reference to be ordered from the handle {% icon classes="fas fa-grip-vertical" /%}
- Drop the reference in the desired place.

If the reference is ordered first, is published and there are no documentations, then it will be the default reference to load for your readers.
