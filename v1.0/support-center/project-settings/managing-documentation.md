Documentations are containers of documentation pages. Each big topic of your project should be contained in a documentation.

## Creating Documentation

To create a documentation:

1. Click on Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-file-alt inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
2. Click on "Create new documentation".
3. Give it a title.

## Publishing Documentation

Documentation by default are not published. Once you are ready to publish (or to unpublish):

1. Click on Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-file-alt inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
2. Below the documentation title at the top, click on the publishing state and modify it as needed.

When a documentation is published and is viewable by readers (because its version is also published), it will appear with a green dot {% icon classes="fas fa-circle green-text" /%} next to it in the sidebar. If its version is unpublished, it will appear with an orange dot {% icon classes="fas fa-circle orange-text" /%}. When the documentation is unpublished, it will appear with a red dot {% icon classes="fas fa-circle red-text" /%} next to it.

## Deleting Documentation

To delete a documentation:

- Click on Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-file-alt inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
- Select the documentation to delete.
- Click on the red bin {% icon classes="far fa-trash-alt red-bg-icon" /%} next to the Documentation title at the top.
- Confirm your deletion.


{% callout type="warning" title="Warning" %}
Once a documentation is deleted, it cannot be retrieved back.
{% /callout %}


## Ordering Documentation

To change a documentation order in the picker:

- Click on Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-file-alt inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
- Drag the documentation to be ordered from the handle {% icon classes="fas fa-grip-vertical" /%}
- Drop the documentation in the desired place.

If the documentation is ordered first and is published, then it will be the default documentation to load for your readers.
