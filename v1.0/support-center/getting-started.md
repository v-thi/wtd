- Styling your content cannot be any easier. Whether your writers are tech people or not, they can format the content using a [toolbar](/support-center/formatting-text), [keyboard shortcuts](/support-center/keyboard-shortcuts), or using [Markdown](/support-center/using-markdown) syntax on the fly 👩‍💻
- Sync your docs with [GitHub](/support-center/github-sync) so everyone can use their local favourite tools to write documentation.
- You can set up a review process with powerful [user permissions](/support-center/collaboration), page [comments](/support-center/comments), [drafting](/support-center/draft-mode) and publishing capabilities.
- [AI-Powered](/support-center/ai-features) with [auto$](/support-center/ai-writer), [auto$](/support-center/ai-search), [META descriptions generator](/support-center/ai-summarisation) and more {% icon classes="fas fa-robot" /%}

- We have native support for [OpenAPI 2 and 3](/support-center/api-references), with an API editor and API playground built-in, so your users can test your APIs right away and you can bring your API References close to your user guides 🗂
- Where you edit your documentation looks the same as the live documentation. You never have to guess how it will look like when it's published 👍
- We take customisation to the next level. Completely modify the look by changing [global CSS](/support-center/custom-css) and injecting [javascript](/support-center/custom-javascript).
