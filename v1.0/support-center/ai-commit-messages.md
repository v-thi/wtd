## Enabling AI Commit Messages

AI commit messages are disabled by default and must be enabled by an admin. To enable AI commit messages:

- From the left sidebar, open **Project Settings** {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group" /%}
- Under **AI**, check **AI Commit Messages**.

Every content change will have its page history annotated by AI.

## What data is sent to OpenAI?

The page content diff is sent to OpenAI when AI annotates page histories.
