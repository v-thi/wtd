## Javascript Functions

### Navigate to URL (Deprecated)

Function: `openLink(event, link)`

Returns: Nothing.

Arguments:

- `event`: the MouseEvent or KeyboardEvent.
- `link`: Absolute path (without host and basepath) such as `/support-center/developer-tools`.

See [Linking to Content](/support-center/custom-landing-page#linking-to-content).

Deprecated: Use [Navigate to Path](/support-center/developer-tools#navigate-to-path) instead.

### Navigate to Path

Function: `navigate(link, options ?: {addBasePath: boolean})`

Returns: Nothing.

Arguments:

- `link`: Absolute path (without host and basepath) such as `/support-center/developer-tools`.
- `options`: (optional)
    - `addBasePath`: Prepends the base path automatically to the link.

Navigates to a path internally inside the single page application, without reloading the page. See [Linking to Content](/support-center/custom-landing-page#linking-to-content).

### Navigate Home

Function `goHome()`

Returns: Nothing.

Arguments: None.

Goes to landing page, or to the default page if no landing page is set. Equivalent to `openLink('/')` when the project has no basepath.

### Make All Landing Page Links Route in SPA

Function: `window.applyClickHandlersOnLinks()`

Returns: Nothing.

Arguments: None.

Captures all absolute paths on a rendered landing page and routes them internally in the single-page application rather than a browser tab navigation. Use after all anchor elements have been rendered on a landing page. See [Custom Landing Page](/support-center/custom-landing-page#adding-javascript).

### Resize Custom HTML iFrame

Function: `window.postMessage('resize', '*');`

Returns: Nothing.

Arguments: Must be provided as is.

Informs the parent element to resize because elements have been dynamically added to the iFrame. See [Resizing Dynamic iFrames](/support-center/custom-html#resizing-dynamic-iframes).

### Apply Advanced Settings

Function: `window.settings.apply(settings)`

Returns: Nothing.

Arguments:

- `settings`: An object containing [specific settings](/support-center/advanced-settings#applying-settings).

Modifies UI or functionality, including search, code theme, SEO and others. See [Applying Settings](/support-center/advanced-settings#applying-settings).

### Modify UI Text

Function: `window.translations.apply(translation)`

Returns: Nothing.

Arguments:

- `translation`: An object containing [certain UI texts that can be changed](/support-center/ui-translation#which-text-can-be-changed).

Modifies UI text, whether for translation or else. See [auto$](/support-center/ui-translation).

### Register Custom Interceptors

Function: `window.registerCustomInterceptor(interceptor)`

Returns: Nothing.

Arguments:

- `interceptor`: A function with two arguments, `data` and `next`. See [Custom Interceptors](/support-center/try-it-out#how-to-set-up-custom-interceptors).

Registers a custom interceptor that can modify API playground requests before they're sent.

### Get Active Version

Function: `window.getActiveVersion()`

Returns: `Version Object {id: number, name: string, slug: string}` or `null`

### Get Active Section

Function: `window.getActiveSection()`

Returns: `Section Object {id: number, title: string, slug: string, type: string}` or `null`

### Get Active Page

Function: `window.getActivePage()`

Returns: `Page Object {id: number, title: string, slug: string}` or `null`

### Zoom Image

Function: `window.zoomImage(src)`

Return: Nothing.

Arguments:

- `src`: The URL of the image to load.

Loads the image in an overlay over the docs, just like when native images are clicked on product.

### Zoom Image from within an iFrame

Function: `window.postMessage({zoomImage: src}, '*')`

Return: Nothing.

Arguments:

- `src`: The URL of the image to load.

Loads the image in an overlay over the docs, just like when native images are clicked on product. Use it when the image is created by a [auto$](/support-center/custom-html) which uses an iFrame (when there is a script or iFrame).
