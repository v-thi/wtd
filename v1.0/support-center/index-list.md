Index list provides a quick way to list all pages under a parent page.

To create an index list:


{% synced id="open-block-menu" %}
{% /synced %}


- Choose Index List {% icon classes="fas fa-list" /%}

A bulleted list containing all child pages, titled and linked, would populate. The list changes dynamically when child pages are added or removed.


{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
If the page has no child pages, then nothing would show for the readers, as if the block doesn't even exist.
{% /callout %}


## Example Index List

This is an up-to-date list of this page's child pages:


{% index-list %}
{% /index-list %}


Doesn't look any different? Correct, that's the point! But it is auto-generated.
