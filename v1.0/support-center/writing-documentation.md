Writing documentation on %product% cannot be any easier. In your editor pages, click anywhere on the text in your documentation and start writing down. You can even use [the AI Writer](/support-center/ai-writer) to help you craft the best content. Everything in the editor will be shown to you just as your readers - no split view.

## Page Sections

Pages must have a **title** and **content**.

### Title

The title of the page will be visible in:

1. The index of the documentation.
2. The title of the browser tab.
3. The URL of the page.

So choose the title carefully to be meaningful to your readers.

### Content

The content of the page can consist of text, [tables](/support-center/tables), [images](/support-center/images), [links](/support-center/page-linking), [code blocks](/support-center/code-blocks), lists, [information boxes](/support-center/callouts), and much more! Have a look at [blocks](/support-center/blocks) to find all the content that we natively support.

## Saving

To save a page, hit the Save Draft button {% icon classes="fas fa-cloud-upload-alt" /%} at the bottom right. Your edits will be saved in [draft mode](/support-center/draft-mode) until you publish them. Every edit you make is saved in the [page history](/support-center/page-history).

When you are ready to publish the changes to your readers, click the Publish button {% icon classes="fas fa-forward" /%}.
