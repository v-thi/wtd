%product% allows documentation to be imported from external sources. The documentation must be supplied in markdown format.

## How to Import Documentation?

To import documentation, follow these steps:

- Make sure your import files are structured as required.
- From the sidebar, open Project Settings {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group inv-icon" /%}
- Click on Import {% icon classes="fas fa-download" /%}
- Choose the appropriate import source.

Importing could take a few seconds up to a minute.

You could also import a single page, see [Import a page into DeveloperHub](/support-center/importing-documentation#import-a-page-into-product) for instructions.


{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
All imports add versions. Versions, documentations and pages are never overwritten.
{% /callout %}



{% callout type="warning" title="Limits" %}
The maximum upload size is 5MB. Contact us if your documentation has a larger size.
{% /callout %}


## Structuring Files

To import documentation from any external sources into %product%, you must structure your files as such:


{% image url="https://uploads.developerhub.io/prod/8gDX/kfbply33iq1ibigabbv7itmaa3qh32923u9j046hwvcxs6pepcmq6y0r8uwc3us7.png" caption="" mode="responsive" height="636" width="694" %}
{% /image %}


Where:

- `v1.0` is the name of your version.
- `Support Center` is the title of your documentation.
- `Getting Started.md` is the title of a documentation page written in Markdown format. `Getting Started` folder indicates that `Getting Started.md` is a parent page, and it has a subpage titled `First Steps.md`.
- `Formatting Text.md`, `Keyboard Shortcuts.md` and `Using Markdown.md` are all subpages of Writing Documentation page.

Every parent page should have a a Markdown file and a folder with the same exact name.

Additionally, you may add OpenAPI spec files in a folder named `refs` in the version folder.

## Limitations of External Sources Import

External sources is unfortunately limited due to the lack of information in the imports. Such limitations are:

- Ordering of the pages.
- Other index elements, such as categories and external links.

## Markdown Import

### What is supported?

1. Code blocks
2. Tables
3. Images
4. Callouts (without title - Title defaults to Info)

## ReadMe Import

To import from ReadMe, you must use the file structure as shown above. All internal links will be modified to match the links in your %product% documentation.

### What is supported?

1. Multi-language code blocks
2. Tables

### ReadMe Import Process

To import from ReadMe:

- Get an export file from ReadMe.
- Unzip the file.
- If you have any recipes or changelogs folders (or any folder that is not user-guides related) then delete them.
- Compress the version folders, and use our import tool, choosing ReadMe as import type.
- Your imported versions will be at the bottom of the version list.
- ReadMe does not provide order information in their exports, so you need to reorder the pages back manually.
- Once you are ready to publish, publish the versions!
