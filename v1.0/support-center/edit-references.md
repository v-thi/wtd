## OpenAPI Editor Features

The OpenAPI Editor is a fully-featured visual web-based editor that supports OpenAPI versions 2.0, 3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.0.2 and 3.0.3. (OpenAPI v3.1.0+ support is upcoming). It helps you build the schema of your OpenAPI reference without needing to know the ins and outs of the specification.

## Editing an API Definition

To edit an existing API definition:

- From the sidebar, choose Reference {% icon classes="fas fa-vector-square" /%}.
- Choose the API Reference to be edited from the list.
- Once the API Reference has loaded, click on Edit in the bottom right side of the screen. The API Editor will load in a new tab.
- Make the changes. Click Save Draft when done.

Once you are ready to publish the API Reference, a publisher may click Publish button on the API Reference.

## Create a new API Definition

To create a new API definition using our OpenAPI editor:

- From the sidebar, choose Reference {% icon classes="fas fa-vector-square" /%}.
- Choose "Create new OpenAPI 3 reference". The API editor will launch in a new tab.
