We audit all actions on %product% made by your team. These include the creation, update and deletion of the following:

- Projects
- Versions
- Documentation
- Pages
- Indices (Categories, Links, ...)
- API References
- Imports
- Users / Teammates
- API Key
- Landing Page

The activity log is scoped as such:

- Content
- Users
- Security
- Hosting
- Other

Admins are able to see all all logged activity. Users with other roles would only see logged activity that are concerned with content.

On the dashboard, the last 100 logs will show.

### Enterprise Auditing

Enterprise users can query full audit log for any activity in the past 6 months using our [API](/v1.0/api/ref#get-audit-log). The audit log would show details of each change.

Example of how to query full audit log is as such:


{% code %}
{% tab language="bash" title="cURL" %}
curl --request GET \
 --header "X-Api-Key: 689bbce8acc68b7a4346acca6a028e6f8126eb792b19a334f8e3f2a12ca8f561"
 --url https://api.developerhub.io/api/v1/audit?max_date=2021-01-19T21:08:44%2B0000
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}
