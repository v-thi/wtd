Supercharged plan users can collaborate with their teammates on [reviewing](/support-center/comments) and writing documentation. Teammates can have different [roles](/support-center/collaboration#user-roles).

## User Roles

Each teammate can have one of the four user roles that we support. The roles are - in the order of most authoritative to least:

- **Admin**, where **Owner** is always an admin.
- **Publisher**
- **Writer**
- **Reviewer**

A breakdown of the permissions is detailed below:

## Setting up Teammates

- If you are on a paid plan, you can invite your teammates to collaborate from the Team menu.
- Open the Team {% icon classes="fas fa-users-cog inv-icon" /%} menu from the sidebar.
- Click on "Invite teammate to collaborate" {% icon classes="fas fa-plus" /%}
- Enter the e-mail address of the teammate to invite. You can add multiple at the same time by separating them with a comma.
- If you want to change their role, click on their badge and change it.
- If you want to change their name, click on their badge and select "Edit Name".

If they are not already a user, an e-mail message will be sent to the e-mail address to help them sign up. They will be added in the list, and an "Invited" badge will be next to their e-mail address until they are signed up.

If they are already a user, an e-mail message will be sent to their e-mail address to notify them that they can collaborate on this project. They will be automatically added and no prompt is required from them.

## Remove a Teammate

To remove a teammate, do the following:

- Open the Team {% icon classes="fas fa-users-cog inv-icon" /%} menu from the sidebar.
- Click on the badge next to the user and select "Remove teammate".

If your organisation is managed (for Enterprise), check [Deprovisioning Users](/support-center/single-sign-on--sso-#deprovisioning-users).

## Changing Project Ownership

To move ownership to another teammate:

1. Make sure that the user has been invited, has already joined the project as a teammate.
2. Open the Team {% icon classes="fas fa-users-cog inv-icon" /%} menu from the sidebar.
3. Click on the badge next to the user and select "Make Owner".
4. Confirm your choice. The user will receive an e-mail that they became an owner of the project.


{% callout type="warning" title="Transferring Ownership" %}
Once you transfer ownership, you cannot take it back unless if the new owner transfers it back to you.
{% /callout %}



{% callout type="info" title="Invoicing is not connected to ownership" %}
If you have a supercharged plan, then the invoice by default would be sent to the e-mail address of the user who purchased the plan, not the owner. If you wish to modify the e-mail used for receiving invoices, check [Changing Payment/Billing Details](/support-center/supercharged-plans#changing-paymentbilling-details).
