%product% documentation index contains six elements:

- [Pages](/support-center/managing-pages)
- [Sub-Pages](/support-center/managing-pages#adding-subpage)
- [Categories](/support-center/categories)
- [auto$](/support-center/code-steps)
- [Links](/support-center/external-links)
- [Separators](/support-center/categories#separators)

All elements can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping them.


{% callout type="info" title="Long Dragging" %}
To re-order an element far away in the index, you can either:

- Click on its menu, choose Re-arrange, then a category to send the element to its bottom.
- Drag the element to the absolute top or absolute bottom of the index, the index will start scrolling automatically.
{% /callout %}


## Index Depth

Index can be three level deep at most. Categories as top-level elements can hold parent pages, and parent pages can hold sub-pages. A sub-page cannot have subpages of its own.


{% callout type="success" title="But why?" %}
A deeper documentation index makes it harder for the reader to find the information they need. A flatter hierarchy provides an easier navigation experience. Remember that complex lengthy subjects can be extracted into separate [documentation](/support-center/managing-documentation). Also, making categories [collapse](/support-center/documentation-settings#collapsible-categories) helps in decluttering the index.
