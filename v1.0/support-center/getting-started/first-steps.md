%product% is very easy to setup. Let's walk you through how to do that.

## Signing Up

You can sign up for free, just head to our [Signup](https://app.developerhub.io/login#signup) page. All we need is your e-mail address to remember who you are and which projects belong to you. You could also sign up using Google.


{% html %}
<div class="text-left">
<a class="doc-button" href="https://app.developerhub.io/signup" target="_blank">Sign up now 🚀</a>
</div>
{% /html %}


## Creating your first project

After signing up, you will be taken to the Getting Started page. You will be asked for your first project's name.

The project name is what will be showing to your users as the title of the page. This usually shows on your browser's tab.

You will also be asked for a subdomain. The subdomain is basically a word containing letters, numbers and hyphens that points to where your documentation will live under developerhub.io domain. The subdomain will be unique to you as long as you are registered on %product%. For example, if your subdomain was `pied-piper`, then your documentation will be accessible through `pied-piper.developerhub.io`.


{% callout type="success" title="Congratulations" %}
You've set up your first project on DeveloperHub.io.
{% /callout %}


If you would like to set up your project to be reachable on your own domain, see [Using Custom Domain](/support-center/using-custom-domain).
