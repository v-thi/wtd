# Write The Docs - DeveloperHub.io
✍️ Improve the DeveloperHub.io Documentation (Hands-on!)

## Description
DeveloperHub.io is a platform for building beautiful, maintainable developer portals and documentation sites. We’d love your help improving our own documentation, and you can do it right inside DeveloperHub.io itself!

You’ll get access to our platform (via UI and GitHub sync) and can try out our AI writing assistant to edit, enhance, or restructure pages. This is a hands-on opportunity to both contribute to a live product and explore a modern docs-as-code platform.

## Ways you can contribute
✅ Use the AI writer to suggest rewrites, clarifications, or summaries of existing content

✅ Identify unclear or incomplete explanations and improve them

✅ Reorganize content for better flow or discoverability

✅ Add missing examples, screenshots, or diagrams

✅ Improve accessibility and plain language

✅ Provide feedback on the AI writer’s outputs—what works well, what could improve


## Recognition
🎉 Everyone who contributes improvements will be credited as a contributor on our GitHub repository.
Your work will be acknowledged publicly, and you’ll be helping other users of DeveloperHub with clearer, better docs.
